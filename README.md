# C-Cpp-Java-Python-coding-differences
These four programming languages are the most popular among the coders in terms of competitive coding and programming.  C is structure/procedure oriented programming language as well as fast. C++ as of today in its efficiency, speed, and memory make it widely popular among coders. Java is platform-independent. It continues to add considerable value to the world of software development. Python requires less typing, provides new libraries, fast prototyping, and several other new features.
C is the the first language that was very popular . It was designed to be very light. The popularity and impact of C can be seen in the fact that most languages that succeeded it are heavily influenced by it.  

C++ it was an effort to bring Object Oriented Programming elements into C. This helps us model programs as per real world objects. It was the first attempt to add OOP into the C language.

Both C and C++ had a common basic problem--- they were platform dependent. This problem was become a major obstacle in their use over the internet. This lead to the rise of JAVA. Java was designed on the basis of C and C++ it removed the problem of Platform Dependency. It also tried to reduce the burden on programmers by adding many more buit in functions on this already heavy platform.

As the size of the Java libraries increased they were using too much space. More over the while executing these programs you need as much free space on the server as the size of the program. That is to say You need 2KB of free space to run a  2KB Java program. With modern data internet traffic it is not a luxury that the back-end servers can afford. So a much lighter language Python is being used . Python was originally developed in the nineties but has gained popularity over in the last few years. It is much lighter and It is possible to run a 10 KB python program with as much free memory as the  largest step.That is if the step which requires the largest memory is 3KB. The program can run with just 3 KB of space . It is extremely fast and it is also built on a framework of C.
